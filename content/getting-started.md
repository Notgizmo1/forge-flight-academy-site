**New to drones?** This guide walks you through everything you need to know to fly legally and safely in the United States.

Whether you're flying for fun or starting a drone business, we'll help you understand FAA requirements and get you in the air the right way.

---

## Step 1: Determine Your Flight Type

The FAA has different rules depending on **why** you're flying. Choose the path that matches your situation:

### Flying for Fun (Recreational)

You're flying recreationally if you fly purely for personal enjoyment with **no compensation** of any kind.

**Examples of recreational flying:**
- Taking photos for personal use
- Flying with friends at the park
- Racing drones as a hobby
- Learning to fly for enjoyment

**[Jump to Recreational Requirements →](#recreational-flying)**

---

### Flying for Work (Commercial - Part 107)

You need a Part 107 certificate if you fly for **any purpose other than pure recreation**.

**Examples of commercial flying:**
- Real estate photography
- Roof inspections
- Wedding videography
- Agricultural surveys
- Any flying for payment or business purposes
- Volunteer work for organizations (even unpaid)

**Important:** Even if you're not being paid directly, if the flight benefits a business or organization, it's commercial.

**[Jump to Commercial Requirements →](#commercial-part-107-flying)**

---

### Not Sure Which One?

**When in doubt, fly under Part 107 commercial rules.** This gives you the most flexibility and keeps you compliant with FAA regulations.

---

## Recreational Flying

### Requirements Checklist

To fly recreationally, you must:

☐ **1. Register your drone** (if 0.55 lbs or heavier)
