## Electronics Repair for Deployed Operators

**Field-level electronics repair without bench equipment.** Develop capability to diagnose, repair, and sustain UAS electronics in austere operational environments.

### Program Overview

This program develops practical electronics repair skills for field conditions. Training emphasizes rapid diagnosis and repair without extensive lab equipment—maintaining operational readiness with minimal supply chain support.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Soldering and desoldering techniques
- Component-level troubleshooting and diagnosis
- Motor, ESC, and flight controller repair
- Sensor and camera system repair
- Power system diagnostics
- Field-expedient repair techniques

### Who Should Attend

**Primary Audience:**
- Deployed UAS operators
- Unit maintenance personnel
- Special operations support elements
- Forward deployed technical personnel
- Training cadre teaching sustainment

**Prerequisites:** Basic UAS operations experience

### Training Approach

Hands-on repair of actual failed components. Students diagnose real failures, perform repairs, and validate functionality. Emphasis on speed and field conditions—not laboratory perfection.

### Program Outcomes

Upon completion, operators demonstrate capability to:
- Diagnose common electronic failures in field conditions
- Perform component-level repairs with portable tools
- Solder connections reliably under time pressure
- Troubleshoot power and sensor systems
- Maintain operational readiness with degraded supply chain
