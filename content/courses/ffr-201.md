## Tactical RF Fundamentals for UAS Operators

**Address the most lethal capability gap:** operators who cannot diagnose and overcome electronic warfare threats in real-time. Based on Ukrainian combat lessons learned and operational requirements in contested electromagnetic environments.

### Program Overview

This program develops spectrum awareness and RF diagnostic capabilities for UAS operators. Training focuses on understanding communications as contested, fragile dependencies and developing the ability to recognize and respond when the spectrum is degraded or denied.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- RF fundamentals and propagation characteristics
- Control versus payload versus telemetry links
- Link budget calculation and validation
- GPS dependency and alternatives
- Electronic warfare countermeasures
- Spectrum coordination with electromagnetic warfare teams

### Who Should Attend

**Primary Audience:**
- UAS operators in EW-contested environments
- Unit electronic warfare coordinators
- Tactical UAS instructors
- Military intelligence operators
- Special operations UAS elements

**Prerequisites:** Basic UAS operations experience recommended

### Training Approach

Emphasis on practical skills development—not academic RF engineering theory. Operators learn to recognize RF problems in operational contexts and apply field-expedient solutions without requiring deep technical backgrounds.

### Program Outcomes

Upon completion, operators demonstrate capability to:
- Diagnose common RF link problems in field conditions
- Apply countermeasures to electronic warfare threats
- Coordinate UAS operations with unit electromagnetic warfare officers
- Operate effectively in GPS-degraded environments
- Maintain situational awareness in contested spectrum
