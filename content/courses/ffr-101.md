## RF Awareness for Non-Technical Personnel

**Executive overview of RF and electronic warfare** for commanders, staff officers, and decision-makers. No technical background required—focused on operational implications and coordination requirements.

### Program Overview

This program provides non-technical personnel with practical understanding of RF spectrum operations and electronic warfare as they impact UAS operations. Focus on informed decision-making and coordination—not engineering implementation.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- RF spectrum fundamentals and allocation
- Electronic warfare threat overview
- GPS dependency and alternatives
- UAS vulnerability to EW threats
- Coordination with electromagnetic warfare officers (S-6/G-6)
- Operational planning considerations

### Who Should Attend

**Primary Audience:**
- Commanders and staff officers
- Operations officers planning UAS employment
- Intelligence officers assessing EW threats
- Acquisition officers evaluating systems
- Senior leaders requiring RF literacy

**Prerequisites:** None required

### Training Approach

Practical examples from operational environments. Focus on what leaders need to know to make informed decisions about UAS employment in contested spectrum—not how RF systems work at the component level.

### Program Outcomes

Upon completion, personnel demonstrate understanding of:
- How EW threatens UAS operations
- When to engage electromagnetic warfare officers
- Operational planning factors for contested spectrum
- Questions to ask technical teams and operators
- Risk assessment for RF-dependent operations
