## Operational Edge Computing for UAS

**Deploy AI and machine learning at the tactical edge.** Develop capability to process sensor data locally, make autonomous decisions, and operate effectively in disconnected environments without cloud connectivity.

### Program Overview

This program develops practical edge computing skills for UAS operators. Training emphasizes deployable AI systems that operate in bandwidth-constrained, disconnected operational environments.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Edge computing hardware (Jetson Nano/Xavier, similar platforms)
- Computer vision and object detection (YOLO, similar frameworks)
- Real-time target recognition and tracking
- Autonomous decision-making at the edge
- Mission-specific AI model deployment

### Who Should Attend

**Primary Audience:**
- UAS operators requiring advanced autonomy
- Intelligence analysts integrating AI workflows
- Technical personnel supporting tactical UAS
- Research and development teams
- Advanced operator training cadre

**Prerequisites:** Basic UAS operations experience, basic computing literacy

### Training Approach

Hands-on deployment of edge computing systems on actual UAS platforms. Students configure hardware, deploy AI models, and validate performance in operational scenarios.

### Program Outcomes

Upon completion, operators demonstrate capability to:
- Configure edge computing hardware for UAS deployment
- Deploy and validate AI models for specific missions
- Troubleshoot edge computing systems in field conditions
- Assess AI performance and reliability
- Integrate edge AI into tactical operations
