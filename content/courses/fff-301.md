## Additive Manufacturing for UAS Sustainment

**3D printing for field manufacturing of replacement parts.** Develop capability to design, print, and deploy structural components in forward locations—reducing dependency on traditional supply chains.

### Program Overview

This program develops practical additive manufacturing skills for UAS sustainment. Training emphasizes rapid part replacement, not aerospace-grade production. Focus on keeping platforms operational with field-manufactured components.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- FDM/FFF 3D printing fundamentals
- Material selection for UAS applications (LW-PLA, PETG, others)
- Design for printability and rapid iteration
- Field printing in austere environments
- Structural component fabrication
- Testing and validation of printed parts

### Who Should Attend

**Primary Audience:**
- Unit sustainment personnel
- Forward deployed maintenance teams
- Research and development personnel
- Training cadre teaching field fabrication
- Special operations support elements

**Prerequisites:** Basic UAS operations experience, basic computer literacy

### Training Approach

Hands-on printing of actual UAS components. Students design parts, configure printers, print components, and test functionality on actual platforms.

### Program Outcomes

Upon completion, personnel demonstrate capability to:
- Design printable replacement parts from failed components
- Configure and operate FDM/FFF printers
- Select appropriate materials for different applications
- Troubleshoot common printing failures
- Validate printed parts for operational use
