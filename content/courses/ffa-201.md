## AI Fundamentals for Non-Technical Personnel

**Executive overview of artificial intelligence and machine learning** for commanders, staff officers, and decision-makers. No technical background required—focused on operational implications, capabilities, and limitations.

### Program Overview

This program provides non-technical personnel with practical understanding of AI/ML technologies as they apply to UAS operations and military applications. Focus on informed decision-making, not engineering implementation.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- AI/ML capabilities and limitations in operational contexts
- Autonomous systems and human-in-the-loop control
- Edge computing and tactical AI deployment
- Ethical considerations and legal frameworks
- Risk assessment and validation approaches

### Who Should Attend

**Primary Audience:**
- Commanders and staff officers
- Acquisition officers and program managers
- Policy makers and strategic planners
- Legal and ethics advisors
- Senior leaders requiring AI literacy

**Prerequisites:** None required

### Training Approach

Practical examples from UAS operations and military applications. Focus on what leaders need to know to make informed decisions about AI integration—not how to build AI systems.

### Program Outcomes

Upon completion, personnel demonstrate understanding of:
- Realistic AI capabilities versus marketing hype
- When AI is appropriate versus inappropriate for specific tasks
- Risk factors and validation requirements
- Ethical and legal considerations
- Questions to ask technical teams and vendors
