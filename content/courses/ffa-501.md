## Advanced Autonomy Employment & Mission Planning

**Complex autonomous missions and multi-aircraft coordination.** Advanced ArduPilot/PX4 configuration for BVLOS operations, coordinated swarms, and sophisticated mission profiles.

### Program Overview

This program develops advanced autonomy employment skills for complex operational scenarios. Training covers mission planning, multi-aircraft coordination, and autonomous operations beyond visual line of sight.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- ArduPilot/PX4 advanced configuration
- Complex waypoint missions and conditional logic
- Multi-aircraft coordination and deconfliction
- BVLOS operations planning and execution
- Autonomous swarm behaviors
- Degraded autonomy contingency planning

### Who Should Attend

**Primary Audience:**
- Advanced UAS operators
- Mission planners and tactical coordinators
- Research and development personnel
- Instructor cadre developing training programs
- Units requiring sophisticated autonomous capabilities

**Prerequisites:** Intermediate UAS operations experience, flight controller familiarity

### Training Approach

Progressive complexity from single-aircraft autonomous missions to coordinated multi-aircraft operations. Emphasis on mission planning, risk management, and contingency procedures.

### Program Outcomes

Upon completion, operators demonstrate capability to:
- Plan and execute complex autonomous missions
- Configure multi-aircraft coordination
- Manage BVLOS operations within regulatory frameworks
- Implement degraded autonomy contingencies
- Assess autonomous system performance and reliability
