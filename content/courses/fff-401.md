## FLAGSHIP PROGRAM

**Transform personnel with zero FPV experience into operationally proficient pilots.** This comprehensive program addresses the critical capability gap: units needing rapid FPV deployment without lengthy training pipelines or contractor dependency.

### Program Overview

This intensive training program covers complete aircraft assembly, flight controller configuration, progressive flight training, and tactical mission execution. Based on Army UALC standards and Ukrainian operational lessons learned.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Complete FPV system assembly from components
- Flight controller configuration and tuning
- Intensive simulator and progressive live flight training
- Tactical mission execution and ISR coordination
- Field sustainment and repair capabilities

### Who Should Attend

**Primary Audience:**
- Infantry platoons requiring organic FPV capability
- Special operations elements
- Forward observers and reconnaissance teams
- Combat engineers conducting breach operations
- Military intelligence collection teams

**Prerequisites:** None required (designed for zero prior experience)

### Training Approach

Students build complete FPV systems from components, configure advanced flight controllers, and progress through intensive simulator training before live flight operations. The program emphasizes operator self-sufficiency and field sustainment capabilities—not contractor dependency.

### Program Outcomes

Upon completion, operators demonstrate proficiency in:
- Building complete FPV aircraft from components
- Configuring flight controller systems for tactical operations
- Flying tactical maneuvers in operational scenarios
- Conducting field repairs and sustainment
- Integrating FPV into small unit operations

### Certification

Graduates receive **FPV Tactical Operator Level 1 Certificate** with 24-month validity, including capability ratings across five proficiency domains.
