# Practical UAS Development: From CAD to Autonomous Flight

**⭐ FLAGSHIP PROGRAM**

From zero to autonomous flight in 10 days. Design, 3D print, assemble, program, and fly your own aircraft.

---

## Course Overview

This intensive 10-day program takes students through the **complete UAS development lifecycle**—from CAD design and 3D printing through ArduPilot configuration and autonomous mission execution. You'll build a **fully functional Group 2 fixed-wing aircraft** and leave with the knowledge to replicate the process.

**Platform:** 1600mm twin-motor fixed-wing ("Moose")  
**Duration:** 10 days (80 contact hours)  
**Schedule:** 8 hours/day + optional evening lab access

---

## What You'll Build

Students design, fabricate, and fly a **purpose-built autonomous recon platform** featuring:

- 1600mm wingspan, 1000mm length twin-motor configuration
- V-tail control surfaces for simplified mechanics
- Fully 3D-printable airframe (LW-PLA lightweight filament)
- Carbon fiber spar reinforcement for structural integrity
- Modular payload bay for mission-specific sensors and equipment
- ArduPilot Plane flight controller with autonomous capability

## Assessment & Certification

Students are evaluated using a **1-5 capability rating scale** across four phases:

**Phase 1: Design & Fabrication** (Can you build the aircraft?)  
**Phase 2: Systems Integration** (Can you wire and configure it?)  
**Phase 3: Manual Flight** (Can you fly it safely?)  
**Phase 4: Autonomous Operations** (Can you program and execute missions?)

**Passing Standard:** 3/5 (Competent) or higher in all phases

**Rating Scale:**
- **5 - Expert:** Can teach others, troubleshoot novel issues
- **4 - Proficient:** Independent operation, handles most scenarios
- **3 - Competent:** PASSING - Performs tasks with occasional guidance
- **2 - Developing:** Requires supervision, building skills
- **1 - Novice:** Learning fundamentals, heavy support needed

**Certificate Awarded:** Practical UAS Development Completion Certificate

— J. Martinez, Department of War Contractor

*"Best training investment our research lab has made. Our team can now design and build custom platforms for our sensor payloads instead of buying off-the-shelf."*  
— Dr. Sarah Chen, University Research Scientist

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I modify the design during the course?**  
A: Yes! Day 1 includes modification planning. The platform specifications are 1600mm wingspan and minimum 1000mm length. Common changes include payload bay customization, landing gear selection, and paint schemes. Students build, design payloads, test, and keep their completed aircraft.

**Q: What if I can't attend all 10 days?**  
A: Full attendance is required—all 10 full days with minimum 80 contact hours. The curriculum builds sequentially—missing days creates knowledge gaps that prevent capability demonstration.

**Q: Do I need to bring my own tools?**  
A: No. All tools, equipment, and materials are provided. Bring a laptop (Windows/Mac/Linux) for CAD and mission planning software.

**Q: Can I fly the aircraft after the course?**  
A: Yes, you own it! You'll need an FAA Part 107 certificate for commercial use. We provide comprehensive Part 107 prep materials and will fund your exam cost (up to 2 attempts) at a local FAA-authorized test center in Fayetteville. If you don't pass the first time, we provide remedial training before your second attempt. You're responsible for complying with local airspace regulations.

**Q: What's the failure rate?**  
A: ~10% of students don't achieve "Competent" rating in all phases on first attempt. Common issue: insufficient practice on Day 8-9. Students can return for refresher training at reduced cost.

**Q: Is this course ITAR-controlled?**  
A: No. Training covers openly-available ArduPilot software and commercial components. U.S. persons only (no export-controlled content).
