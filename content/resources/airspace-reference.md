# Airspace Quick Reference

A comprehensive guide to navigating U.S. airspace for Part 107 remote pilots.

---

## Quick Decision Chart

**Before every flight, ask:**

1. **Are there any TFRs?** → Check B4UFLY app or tfr.faa.gov
2. **What color are the airspace lines on the chart?**
   - No lines (Class G) → No authorization needed
   - Blue lines (B or D) → Authorization required
   - Magenta lines (C or E) → Authorization may be required
3. **Am I below 400 ft AGL?** → Required for Part 107
4. **Can I see my aircraft?** → VLOS required
5. **Weather good?** → 3 SM visibility, clear of clouds

If all checks pass → **You can fly!**

## Airspace Classes

### Class A Airspace
**🚫 Not Accessible to Drones**

- **Altitude:** 18,000 ft MSL to FL600
- **Authorization:** Not available
- **Chart Symbol:** Not depicted on sectional charts

All Class A operations require IFR clearance. Completely off-limits for Part 107.

---

### Class B Airspace
**🔴 Authorization Required**

- **Altitude:** Surface to ~10,000 ft MSL (varies)
- **Chart Symbol:** Solid blue lines
- **Shape:** Upside-down wedding cake (multiple shelves)
- **Authorization:** ATC required (LAANC or manual)

**Characteristics:**
- Surrounds 30+ busiest U.S. airports (ATL, LAX, ORD, DFW, etc.)
- Multiple altitude layers with different ceilings
- Numbers show altitude in hundreds of feet (e.g., "80/SFC" = surface to 8,000 ft MSL)

**Common Examples:**
- Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta (ATL)
- Los Angeles International (LAX)
- Chicago O'Hare (ORD)
- Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW)

---

### Class C Airspace
**🟡 Authorization Required**

- **Altitude:** Surface to ~4,000 ft AGL
- **Chart Symbol:** Solid magenta lines
- **Shape:** Two-layer cylinder
- **Authorization:** ATC required (LAANC available)

**Structure:**
- **Inner shelf:** Surface to 4,000 ft AGL
- **Outer shelf:** 1,200 ft AGL to 4,000 ft AGL
- Radius typically 5/10 nautical miles

Surrounds busy airports with IFR operations and passenger service.

---

### Class D Airspace
**🔵 Authorization Required (When Tower Operating)**

- **Altitude:** Surface to ~2,500 ft AGL
- **Chart Symbol:** Dashed blue lines
- **Shape:** Cylinder
- **Authorization:** ATC required when tower is operating

**Critical Detail:** Only exists when control tower is operational. When tower closes:
- Reverts to Class E or G airspace
- Check Chart Supplement for tower operating hours
- Typically 4 NM radius from airport

---

### Class E Airspace
**🟣 Authorization May Be Required**

- **Altitude:** Various (700 ft, 1,200 ft, or surface)
- **Chart Symbol:** Magenta or blue dashed/shaded lines
- **Authorization:** Check LAANC availability

**Three Types:**

#### Surface Area (Class E to Surface)
- Dashed magenta line around airports
- Non-towered airports with instrument approaches
- Authorization may be required

#### 700 ft AGL Transition
- Magenta shading/vignette on chart
- Most common around airports
- Controlled airspace starts at 700 ft AGL

#### 1,200 ft AGL (Default)
- No specific chart marking
- Everything not otherwise classified
- Extends upward from 1,200 ft AGL

---

### Class G Airspace
**🟢 No Authorization Required**

- **Altitude:** Surface to base of overlying airspace
- **Chart Symbol:** No marking (absence of other classes)
- **Authorization:** None needed

**Part 107 Rules Still Apply:**
- 400 ft AGL maximum
- 3 statute miles visibility
- Clear of clouds
- Daylight operations (or anti-collision lighting at night)

Most common below 1,200 ft AGL in rural areas.

## Special Use Airspace

### Prohibited Areas (P-XX)
**🚫 Strictly Forbidden**

- Chart: Blue hatching with "P-XX" designation
- Entry absolutely not allowed
- Examples: White House (P-56), Camp David

**Penalties for violation:** Civil fines, possible criminal charges

---

### Restricted Areas (R-XX)
**⚠️ Permission Required**

- Chart: Blue hatching with "R-XX" designation
- Military operations, artillery, hazardous activities
- Check Chart Supplement for:
  - Operating hours/days
  - Controlling agency contact
  - Altitude limits

Some restricted areas have specific hours—may be accessible when not active.

---

### Warning Areas (W-XX)
**⚠️ Caution Advised**

- Chart: Blue hatching with "W-XX"
- Located over water (beyond 3 NM from coast)
- Entry not legally restricted but hazardous activity present
- Expect military training, weapons testing

---

### Military Operations Areas (MOA)
**⚠️ High Military Activity**

- Chart: Magenta hatching
- High-speed military aircraft training
- Not restricted but exercise caution
- Check NOTAMs for activation times

---

### Alert Areas (A-XX)
**ℹ️ High Traffic Volume**

- Chart: Magenta hatching with "A-XX"
- High pilot training or unusual activity
- Entry not restricted
- Maintain heightened awareness

---

## Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs)

**Check Before EVERY Flight!**

### Common TFR Types:
1. **Presidential Movement** - 30 NM radius, strictly enforced
2. **Sporting Events** - Stadium TFRs, typically 3 NM/3,000 ft
3. **Disaster Areas** - Forest fires, hurricanes, search & rescue
4. **Special Events** - Air shows, rocket launches
5. **National Security** - Various locations

### Where to Check:
- **B4UFLY app** (FAA official app)
- **tfr.faa.gov** (FAA TFR website)
- **1-800-WX-BRIEF** (Flight Service)

### Penalties:
- Civil penalties up to $30,000
- Certificate suspension/revocation
- Criminal penalties for security TFRs
- Possible aircraft seizure

**When in doubt, don't fly!**

## Authorization Methods

### LAANC (Recommended)
**Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability**

- **Speed:** Near real-time (seconds to minutes)
- **Availability:** Most controlled airspace up to 400 ft
- **Cost:** Free or small fee
- **Apps:** Aloft, AirMap, Kittyhawk, Airspace Link

**How it works:**
1. Open LAANC app
2. Enter location and altitude
3. Receive instant approval (if in grid)
4. Fly authorized operation

---

### Manual Authorization
**For areas without LAANC**

- **Speed:** 90+ days processing
- **Portal:** FAA DroneZone
- **Cost:** Free
- **Use when:** LAANC unavailable or requesting >400 ft

## Pre-Flight Airspace Checklist

☐ Checked for active TFRs  
☐ Identified airspace class at location  
☐ Obtained authorization if required  
☐ Verified tower operating hours (Class D)  
☐ Checked NOTAM for special restrictions  
☐ Confirmed altitude below 400 ft AGL  
☐ Downloaded LAANC authorization (if used)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Assuming Class G everywhere** - Always check charts  
❌ **Flying in Class D after tower closes** - Still need to check resulting class  
❌ **Ignoring TFRs** - Check every single flight  
❌ **Not getting authorization** - "I didn't know" is not a defense  
❌ **Flying above 400 ft AGL** - Even in Class G  
❌ **Relying on old information** - Airspace and TFRs change frequently
