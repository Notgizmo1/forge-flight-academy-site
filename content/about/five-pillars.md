## The Five-Pillar Capability Framework

Forge and Flight Academy training operates across five interconnected capability domains that work together to create comprehensive technical competency. **This is not a course categorization system**—it's an integrated training methodology where every course touches multiple pillars.

---

### Pillar I: Unmanned & Autonomous Systems

**Platform design, assembly, operation, and sustainment**

This pillar covers the end-to-end lifecycle of unmanned systems from design intent through field sustainment. Students learn platforms as integrated systems—not just flyable objects.

**Core Competencies:**
- FPV multirotor systems (build, operate, repair)
- Fixed-wing and VTOL platforms
- Autopilot configuration (PX4/ArduPilot)
- Power systems and propulsion fundamentals
- Payload integration
- Mission planning and failure analysis
- Operator-level autonomy supervision

**Philosophy:** Students do not "learn to fly." They learn how systems fail, degrade, and recover.

---

### Pillar II: RF, Spectrum & Communications

**Datalinks, jamming resistance, spectrum awareness**

This pillar focuses on understanding communications as a contested, fragile dependency. Operators develop spectrum awareness and learn to diagnose and overcome electronic warfare threats.

**Core Competencies:**
- RF fundamentals (propagation, noise, interference)
- Control vs payload vs telemetry links
- Link budget calculation and validation
- GPS dependency and alternatives
- Electronic warfare countermeasures
- Spectrum coordination with S-6/G-6
- Counter-UAS perspective

**Philosophy:** Operators don't need to be RF engineers—they need to recognize when the spectrum is lying to them.

---

### Pillar III: Field Fabrication & Sustainment

**Repair, modification, additive manufacturing**

This pillar emphasizes operator-level repair and field sustainment. Students learn to build, maintain, and repair platforms in austere environments without contractor support.

**Core Competencies:**
- Soldering and electronics repair
- Component-level troubleshooting
- 3D printing for replacement parts
- Tool-free field repairs
- Supply chain awareness
- Damage assessment and recovery
- Improvisation and adaptation

**Philosophy:** Reduce contractor reliance. Enable rapid recovery after attrition. Maintain operational readiness with minimal supply chain.

---

### Pillar IV: Autonomy, AI & Edge Computing

**Flight controllers, mission planning, AI integration**

This pillar covers autonomous flight operations, mission planning, and emerging AI/ML technologies for tactical edge deployment.

**Core Competencies:**
- ArduPilot/PX4 advanced configuration
- Waypoint navigation and mission planning
- Geofencing and failsafe configuration
- Edge computing for real-time processing
- Computer vision and target recognition
- Autonomous decision-making
- Multi-aircraft coordination

**Philosophy:** Understand autonomy as operator-supervised capability, not replacement for human judgment.

---

### Pillar V: Capability Assessment & Technical Evaluation

**Objective proficiency evaluation and readiness validation**

This pillar provides standardized assessment frameworks for measuring individual, unit, and organizational capability. Assessments are practical—not multiple choice exams.

**Core Competencies:**
- Individual operator proficiency evaluation (1-5 scale)
- Unit readiness assessment
- Training program effectiveness
- Equipment capability validation
- Instructor certification and quality assurance
- Continuous improvement processes

**Philosophy:** Third-party objective validation provides credible capability reporting for commanders and acquisition officers.

## How Pillars Work Together

**Example: FFF-401 Advanced FPV Systems Integration**

This flagship course spans ALL five pillars:

**Pillar I (100%):** Build complete FPV aircraft from components, fly tactical missions  
**Pillar II (80%):** Configure RF datalinks, troubleshoot jamming, understand spectrum  
**Pillar III (100%):** Assemble from scratch, field repair techniques, soldering  
**Pillar IV (60%):** Flight controller configuration, basic autonomous waypoint missions  
**Pillar V (80%):** Practical proficiency assessment at course completion

Students don't take five separate courses—they experience integrated training where all capabilities reinforce each other.

## Why This Framework Matters

### 1. Comprehensive Capability Development

Traditional training teaches single skills. The Five-Pillar Framework develops complete operators who understand how all systems work together.

### 2. Operational Self-Sufficiency

Units trained through this framework can build, sustain, and adapt platforms without contractor support. When a platform is lost downrange, graduates rebuild it—they don't wait for acquisition.

### 3. Future-Ready Skills

AI, autonomy, and electronic warfare aren't separate specialties—they're integrated into operational training from day one.

### 4. Measurable Proficiency

Standardized assessment across all five pillars provides commanders with objective capability reporting. No more subjective "trained/not trained" status.

### 5. Scalable Through Train-the-Trainer

Organizations can establish internal training programs using our curriculum and instructor certification—achieving sustainable capability without perpetual commercial training.

## Framework in Action

**Small Unit Example:**

An infantry platoon completing FFF-401 gains:
- **Pillar I:** Organic FPV capability for reconnaissance
- **Pillar II:** Ability to operate in EW-contested environments
- **Pillar III:** Field repair without supply chain delays
- **Pillar IV:** Autonomous waypoint missions for persistent surveillance
- **Pillar V:** Validated proficiency ratings for readiness reporting

**Result:** Platoon can deploy, sustain, and employ UAS independently without external support.

---

## Not a Course Catalog System

**Common Misconception:** "Pillar II courses teach RF, Pillar III courses teach fabrication."

**Reality:** Every course touches multiple pillars. FFF-401 covers all five. FFR-201 emphasizes Pillar II but includes Pillar I (platform knowledge) and Pillar III (field antenna swaps).

The pillars are a **training methodology**—not a filing system for course organization.
