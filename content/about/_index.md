## About Forge and Flight Academy

**Professional UAS training focused on operational proficiency, not certificates.** We develop operators who can build, sustain, and employ unmanned systems in real operational environments.

---

## What Makes Us Different

### Integrated Ecosystem

Only training organization that builds platforms (Forge & Flight Labs), operates test ranges (AeroRange Systems), and manufactures electronics (American UAS Electronics). Train on systems you'll deploy—not generic consumer platforms.

### Operator Self-Sufficiency

Training emphasizes field sustainment and organic repair capability. Reduce contractor dependency. Enable rapid recovery after platform attrition. Maintain operational readiness with degraded supply chains.

### Five-Pillar Framework

Comprehensive training methodology spanning unmanned systems, RF/spectrum, field fabrication, autonomy/AI, and capability assessment. Not single-skill courses—integrated competency development.

### Future-Ready Curriculum

Training based on Ukrainian operational lessons learned and current SOCOM requirements. AI integration, spectrum warfare, and autonomous systems from day one—not legacy approaches.

### Veteran-Led Instruction

All instructors are FAA-certified remote pilots with real operational experience. Combination of regulatory knowledge and tactical expertise—not academic theory.

### NDAA Compliance

All training platforms use American-made avionics from American UAS Electronics, fully compliant with NDAA Section 848.
