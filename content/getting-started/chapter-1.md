## Choosing Your First UAS Platform

**Understand the three main platform types** and select the right UAS for your operational requirements.

---

### Platform Types Overview

There are three primary UAS platform categories, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

#### Multirotor (Quadcopter/Hexacopter)

Multirotors use multiple propellers for lift and control. Most common type for beginners and commercial operations.

**Advantages:**
- Vertical takeoff and landing (no runway required)
- Stable hover capability for inspection and photography
- Easy to fly with modern flight controllers
- Compact and portable

**Limitations:**
- Short flight time (15-30 minutes typical)
- Limited range (visual line of sight)
- Poor performance in wind
- High battery consumption

**Best For:** Inspections, photography, mapping small areas, indoor operations

---

#### Fixed-Wing

Fixed-wing aircraft generate lift through forward motion, similar to traditional aircraft.

**Advantages:**
- Long endurance (1-3+ hours possible)
- Extended range (several kilometers)
- Efficient battery usage
- Better wind tolerance

**Limitations:**
- Requires runway or launcher
- No hover capability
- More complex flight planning
- Larger operational footprint

**Best For:** Large-area mapping, surveillance, long-distance missions, research

---

#### VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing)

VTOL platforms combine multirotor and fixed-wing characteristics, transitioning between vertical and horizontal flight.

**Advantages:**
- No runway required (vertical takeoff)
- Extended endurance (fixed-wing efficiency)
- Versatile mission capability
- Operational flexibility

**Limitations:**
- Higher cost and complexity
- More maintenance required
- Heavier than pure multirotors
- More complex flight operations

**Best For:** Advanced operations, military applications, research, complex missions

---

### Weight Classifications

The FAA classifies UAS into groups based on weight:

**Group 1:** 0-20 lbs (0-9 kg)
- Most commercial and hobbyist drones
- Part 107 operations
- Minimal regulatory burden

**Group 2:** 21-55 lbs (9.5-25 kg)
- Advanced commercial platforms
- Research aircraft
- May require waivers

**Group 3+:** 55+ lbs (25+ kg)
- Specialized operations
- Significant regulatory requirements
- Typically not suitable for beginners

**For most users, Group 1 platforms offer the best balance of capability and regulatory simplicity.**

### Common Use Cases

**Inspection & Monitoring:**
- Infrastructure inspection (bridges, towers, pipelines)
- Agricultural monitoring
- Facility security
- **Recommended:** Multirotor with high-resolution camera

**Mapping & Survey:**
- Topographic mapping
- Construction site monitoring
- Land survey
- **Recommended:** Fixed-wing for large areas, multirotor for small sites

**Research & Development:**
- Academic research
- Sensor testing
- Algorithm development
- **Recommended:** Platform depends on specific research requirements

**Military & Government:**
- Reconnaissance
- Training
- Tactical operations
- **Recommended:** Consult with Forge and Flight Academy for mission-specific guidance

---

### Budget Considerations

**Entry Level ($500-$2,000):**
- Consumer multirotors (DJI Mini, Air series)
- Suitable for learning and basic operations
- Limited payload and customization

**Professional ($2,000-$10,000):**
- Commercial-grade multirotors
- Entry-level fixed-wing platforms
- Expandable sensor packages

**Advanced ($10,000-$50,000):**
- High-end survey platforms
- VTOL aircraft
- Custom builds
- Specialized sensors

**Military/Research ($50,000+):**
- Custom tactical platforms
- Advanced autonomy
- Specialized payloads
- Contact Forge and Flight Academy for consultation

## Key Takeaways

**Multirotors** are best for beginners, inspections, and hovering operations  
**Fixed-wing** provides endurance and range for large-area missions  
**VTOL** combines both but adds complexity and cost  
**Group 1 platforms** (under 20 lbs) offer best regulatory simplicity  
**Budget** and **mission requirements** drive platform selection
