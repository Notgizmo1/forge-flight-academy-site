### Determine Your Flight Type

The FAA has different rules depending on **why** you're flying.

#### Flying for Fun (Recreational)

You're flying recreationally if you fly purely for personal enjoyment with **no compensation**.

**Examples:**
- Taking photos for personal use
- Flying with friends at the park
- Racing drones as a hobby
- Learning to fly for enjoyment

#### Flying for Work (Commercial - Part 107)

You need a Part 107 certificate if you fly for **any purpose other than pure recreation**.

**Examples:**
- Real estate photography
- Roof inspections
- Wedding videography
- Agricultural surveys
- Any flying for payment or business purposes
- Volunteer work for organizations (even unpaid)

**Important:** Even if you're not being paid directly, if the flight benefits a business or organization, it's commercial.

**When in doubt, fly under Part 107 commercial rules.** This gives you the most flexibility and keeps you compliant.
