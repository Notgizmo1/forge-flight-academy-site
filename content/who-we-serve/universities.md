## Frequently Asked Questions


**Q: Do you offer semester-long courses?**  
A: We typically deliver intensive multi-day courses, but we can consult on semester-long curriculum design for your faculty to teach. Or internship type programs

**Q: Can students keep the aircraft they build?**  
A: For our flagship course, yes. For custom programs, we can structure options for student-owned platforms or university-owned lab equipment.

**Q: What if our students already have Part 107 certificates?**  
A: Great! Our training focuses on hands-on proficiency beyond the exam. We can skip Part 107 prep and focus on platform operations and assessment.

**Q: Can you train international students?**  
A: Yes, for non-ITAR controlled content. Export-controlled training requires proper authorization.

**Q: Do you provide equipment for university labs?**  
A: We can recommend equipment and suppliers for academic budgets. We don't sell equipment directly, but we can connect you with vendors offering educational discounts.
