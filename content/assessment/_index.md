## Why Assessment Services Matter

### Objective Capability Reporting
Replace subjective "trained/not trained" status with standardized proficiency ratings providing commanders with actionable intelligence.

### Validate Training Investment
Measure actual operator capability development—not just attendance. Validate that training programs deliver measurable proficiency improvement.

### Support Acquisition Decisions
Provide objective data for platform selection, training requirement determination, and program of record justification.

### Maintain Readiness Over Time
Identify skill degradation before it impacts operations. Target remediation training where needed rather than broad retraining.

### Third-Party Credibility
Independent assessment provides credibility for capability claims to higher headquarters, acquisition authorities, and oversight organizations.

## Assessment Methodology

**Practical, not academic.** All assessments emphasize demonstrated performance in operational scenarios—not written tests or simulator-only evaluation.

**Standardized criteria.** All evaluators use identical assessment frameworks ensuring consistency across units, locations, and time periods.

**Actionable results.** Reports provide specific remediation recommendations—not just scores. Clear guidance for capability improvement.
