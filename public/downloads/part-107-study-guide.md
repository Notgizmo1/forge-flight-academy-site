# Part 107 Study Guide

Everything you need to prepare for your FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate exam.

## Airspace Classification

Understanding airspace is crucial for Part 107 operations. Here's what you need to know:

### Class A Airspace
**Altitude:** 18,000 ft MSL to FL600  
**Operations:** Not accessible to drones  
**Authorization:** N/A - completely off-limits

### Class B Airspace
**Altitude:** Surface to ~10,000 ft MSL  
**Chart Color:** Solid blue lines  
**Shape:** Upside-down wedding cake  
**Authorization:** ATC authorization required (LAANC or manual)

Surrounds the busiest airports in the U.S. (30+ largest airports including ATL, LAX, ORD, DFW). Multiple altitude layers with different ceilings. Always requires authorization before operating.

### Class C Airspace
**Altitude:** Surface to ~4,000 ft AGL  
**Chart Color:** Solid magenta lines  
**Shape:** Two-layer cylinder  
**Authorization:** ATC authorization required

Surrounds busy airports with IFR operations and passenger service. Inner and outer shelves with different altitude limits. LAANC authorization typically available.

### Class D Airspace
**Altitude:** Surface to ~2,500 ft AGL  
**Chart Color:** Dashed blue lines  
**Shape:** Cylinder  
**Authorization:** ATC authorization required

Surrounds airports with operating control towers. **Important:** Only exists when tower is operational—reverts to Class E or G when tower closes. Always check tower operating hours.

### Class E Airspace
**Altitude:** Various (700 ft AGL, 1,200 ft AGL, or surface)  
**Chart Color:** Magenta or blue dashed/shaded lines  
**Authorization:** May require LAANC depending on location

Controlled airspace not classified as A, B, C, or D. Different types:
- **Surface Area** - Dashed magenta line around airports
- **700 ft AGL** - Magenta shading (most common transition areas)
- **1,200 ft AGL** - No specific marking (default controlled airspace)

### Class G Airspace
**Altitude:** Surface to base of overlying controlled airspace  
**Chart Color:** No marking (absence of other airspace)  
**Authorization:** None required

Uncontrolled airspace, but **Part 107 rules still apply**: 400 ft AGL max, 3 SM visibility, clear of clouds, daylight operations (or with anti-collision lighting).

## Weather Minimums for Part 107

Part 107 requires specific weather conditions:

### Visibility & Cloud Clearance
- **Minimum visibility:** 3 statute miles
- **Cloud clearance:** 500 feet below, 2,000 feet horizontally
- **Operations:** Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) only
- **No operations through clouds** at any altitude

### Understanding METARs
METARs provide current weather observations. Example:

**KFAY 061745Z 09008KT 10SM FEW250 23/14 A3012**

Translation:
- **KFAY** - Fayetteville Regional Airport
- **061745Z** - 6th day, 17:45 UTC
- **09008KT** - Wind from 090° at 8 knots
- **10SM** - 10 statute miles visibility ✓
- **FEW250** - Few clouds at 25,000 feet ✓
- **23/14** - Temperature 23°C, Dew point 14°C
- **A3012** - Altimeter 30.12 inHg

**This meets Part 107 minimums** - visibility >3 SM, clouds well above 500 ft.

### TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast)
Provides weather forecasts for 24-30 hours. Use TAFs to plan flight operations and identify potential weather issues before they arrive.

## Key Part 107 Regulations

### Altitude Limits
- **Maximum:** 400 feet above ground level (AGL)
- **Exception:** Can fly higher than 400 ft when within 400 ft of a structure
- **No waivers** typically granted above 400 ft in most airspace

### Speed Limits
- **Maximum groundspeed:** 100 mph (87 knots)
- Applies to the aircraft, not just cruise speed

### Weight & Registration
- **Under 0.55 lbs** - No registration required
- **0.55 lbs to 55 lbs** - Must register with FAA ($5 for 3 years)
- **Registration number** must be visible on aircraft (externally or in battery compartment)

### Pilot Requirements
- **Minimum age:** 16 years old
- **Remote Pilot Certificate** required (pass Part 107 exam)
- **Certificate validity:** 24 months (recurrent training required)
- **English language proficiency** required

### Visual Line of Sight (VLOS)
- Must maintain visual contact with aircraft **unaided by any device** (except corrective lenses)
- FPV goggles alone do NOT satisfy VLOS requirement
- Visual observer may assist but doesn't replace PIC responsibility

### Operations Over People
Allowed under specific categories:
- **Category 1:** <0.55 lbs
- **Category 2:** <55 lbs, no exposed rotating parts, injury criteria met
- **Category 3:** <55 lbs, operations over crowds with specific restrictions
- **Category 4:** Requires FAA certification

### Night Operations
Permitted if:
- Remote PIC completed recurrent training including night operations
- Aircraft has anti-collision lighting visible for **3 statute miles**
- All other Part 107 rules apply (VLOS, weather minimums, etc.)

### Operations from Moving Vehicles
**Allowed** when operating over sparsely populated areas  
**Prohibited** over densely populated areas

### Prohibited Operations
- ❌ Careless or reckless operation
- ❌ Operations from moving aircraft
- ❌ Carrying hazardous materials
- ❌ Operations that interfere with manned aircraft
- ❌ Flying under the influence (8-hour bottle-to-throttle rule, <0.04% BAC)

### Manual Authorization Request
- **Response time:** 90+ days
- **Use when:** LAANC unavailable or requesting >400 ft altitude
- **Portal:** FAA DroneZone
- **Cost:** Free
