## Best Practices

### Daily Operations
1. **Log immediately after each flight** - Don't rely on memory
2. **Note any anomalies** - Even minor issues matter
3. **Track battery performance** - Identify degradation early
4. **Review logs weekly** - Spot trends and patterns

### Monthly Reviews
- **Calculate total flight hours** across all platforms
- **Review maintenance schedules** for upcoming service
- **Analyze incident trends** for safety improvements
- **Archive completed logs** for long-term storage

### Annual Audits
- **Verify log accuracy** against other records
- **Update retention policies** as needed
- **Archive old records** per policy
- **Update templates** for regulatory changes
