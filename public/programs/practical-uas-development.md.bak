# Practical UAS Development: From CAD to Autonomous Flight

**⭐ FLAGSHIP PROGRAM**

From zero to autonomous flight in 10 days. Design, 3D print, assemble, program, and fly your own aircraft.

---

## Course Overview

This intensive 10-day program takes students through the **complete UAS development lifecycle**—from CAD design and 3D printing through ArduPilot configuration and autonomous mission execution. You'll build a fully functional Group 2 fixed-wing aircraft and leave with the knowledge to replicate the process.

**Platform:** 1600mm twin-motor fixed-wing ("Moose")  
**Duration:** 10 days (80 contact hours)  
**Schedule:** 8 hours/day + optional evening lab access  
**Class Size:** 6-12 students  
**Prerequisites:** None required (all skill levels welcome)

---

## What You'll Learn

By Day 10, you will independently:

✓ **Design & modify aircraft CAD files** in Fusion 360/OnShape  
✓ **3D print complete airframes** using LW-PLA and slicer software  
✓ **Assemble structural components** with carbon reinforcement  
✓ **Integrate power systems** (batteries, ESCs, motors, wiring)  
✓ **Install flight electronics** (flight controller, GPS, telemetry)  
✓ **Configure ArduPilot firmware** and Mission Planner  
✓ **Execute manual flight operations** with smooth control
