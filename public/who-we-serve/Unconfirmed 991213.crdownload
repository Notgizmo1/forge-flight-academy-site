# Department of Defense Training

**Operator-level training for rapid capability development, organic sustainment, and mission-specific adaptation.**

We train **warfighters and researchers** who need to build, modify, and employ unmanned systems in operational environments—not just fly them.

---

## Who We Train

### Special Operations Command (SOCOM)
- **Small unit operators** requiring organic UAS capability
- **FPV systems integration** for reconnaissance and mission support
- **Field sustainment training** for austere environments
- **Custom platform development** for mission-specific requirements

### Service Branch Units
- **Army** - Aviation, engineering, and infantry units
- **Air Force** - Special warfare, test wings, innovation cells
- **Navy** - EOD, SEAL teams, expeditionary units
- **Marine Corps** - Force reconnaissance, artillery, logistics

### Research & Development Organizations
- **Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)**
- **Army Research Laboratory (ARL)**
- **AFWERX** and service innovation labs
- **Science & Technology directorates**

### Government Civilians
- **Acquisition professionals** requiring technical understanding
- **Program managers** overseeing UAS programs
- **Test & evaluation personnel**

---

## Training Focus Areas

### 1. FPV Systems Integration
**Hands-on development of first-person view reconnaissance platforms**

- Platform selection and modification
- Video transmission systems (analog and digital)
- Antenna theory and link optimization
- Contested spectrum operations
- Night operations and thermal integration
- Field repair and sustainment

**Outcome:** Operators can build, configure, and sustain FPV systems organically within the unit.

---

### 2. Autonomous System Employment
**Operator-facing autonomy training for mission execution**

- ArduPilot and PX4 flight controller configuration
- Waypoint mission planning and execution
- Return-to-home and failsafe programming
- Sensor integration (EO/IR, LiDAR, multi-spectral)
- Edge computing and onboard processing
- Degraded autonomy operations (GPS-denied)

**Outcome:** Operators understand autonomy behavior, failure modes, and manual override procedures.

---

### 3. Field Fabrication & Sustainment
**Organic repair, modification, and platform development in austere environments**

- 3D printing for spare parts and modifications
- Soldering and electronics repair
- Airframe damage assessment and repair
- Battery management and charging systems
- Tool kits and field expedient solutions
- Supply chain reduction strategies

**Outcome:** Units reduce contractor dependency and maintain operational tempo without external logistics support.

---

### 4. Spectrum Awareness & RF Operations
**Understanding and mitigating RF vulnerabilities**

- Frequency selection and interference mitigation
- Link budget analysis
- GPS dependency management
- Jamming recognition and response
- Communication security (COMSEC) for C2 links
- Software-defined radio integration

**Outcome:** Operators recognize RF vulnerabilities and adapt operations for contested environments.

---

### 5. Platform-Specific Training
**Tailored instruction for government-issued or unit-owned systems**

We provide operator and maintainer training for:
- Small Group 1 UAS (Raven, Puma, etc.)
- Group 2 fixed-wing platforms
- Multi-rotor systems (quadcopters, hexacopters)
- VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) platforms
- Custom or developmental systems

**Outcome:** Proficiency on specific platforms with capability-based assessment.

---

## Delivery Options

## Assessment & Certification

### Capability Rating System (1-5 Scale)

Unlike traditional pass/fail certifications, we evaluate **demonstrable proficiency**:

**5 - Expert:** Can teach others, troubleshoot novel issues independently  
**4 - Proficient:** Independent operation, handles most failure modes  
**3 - Competent:** PASSING STANDARD - Performs tasks with occasional guidance  
**2 - Developing:** Requires supervision, building foundational skills  
**1 - Novice:** Learning fundamentals, requires heavy support

**Assessment Domains:**
- Design & Fabrication
- Systems Integration
- Manual Flight Operations
- Autonomous Mission Execution
- Field Repair & Troubleshooting

### Post-Training Documentation

Graduates receive:
- **Individual capability assessment** (1-5 rating per domain)
- **Training completion certificate**
- **Recommended training progression** for skill development
- **90-day post-course support** for technical questions

---
